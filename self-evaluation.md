## Q1: I feel pretty confident (8/10) when it comes to arrays, even though I think it took me a little longer than average to complete this one. I am glad I stuck it out, and very happy with the programs I wrote showing my understanding of index position and applying methods. I am curious how we will apply arrays to real world programming.

## Q2: I think there's tons of more learning I could do with arrays, because there are still so many more methods I found during my research that I have yet to apply (or ever understand how to). I doubt it's possible to learn them all before next lesson, but I am prepared to utilize them in the future.

## Q3: My main question about arrays retains to something said in the lesson about using arrays to store more than one kind of DataType. I am wondering why you would ever want to do this? Where could I see some examples of this?
